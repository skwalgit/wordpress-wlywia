### WordPress
- I have added sa custom sage/roots theme framework to use as a theme.
- I used bootstrap 5 framework to make the design a little bit faster.
- This theme uses laravel/mix for sass and js compiler.
- The theme uses laravel's blade template engine for wp templates.
- I have included the database for the WordPress in the root folder.
- The code for the frontend was only static and can be found at `resources/views/partials/content-page.blde.php` of the theme.

### Plugin
- I followed the demo plugin structure.
- Everything is from scratch.
- No extra feature added due to lack of development time.
