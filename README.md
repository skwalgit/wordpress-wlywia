### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a WordPress theme & plugin and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

### Brief

The design team at BD Labs LLC has provided you with designs for a new landing page! Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to implement. Also, your task is to write a plugin that allows customers to schedule demo calls with the sales team.

### Tasks

-   Implement a WordPress theme and get it looking as close to design as possible
-   Make use of the included style-guide.md
-   Your users should be able to:
    -   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    -   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    -   Create the background shape using code
-   In the provided WordPress folder, you will find a boilerplate plugin called <codesubmit-schedule-demo>
-   The plugin should be configurable in the WordPress Admin with the following settings
    -   Availabilty (e.g. Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm)
    -   Phone Number
-   The plugin should include a shortcode. The shortcode will render a button, that if clicked, launches a modal. The modal's content should be as follows: If the button is clicked within the "opening hours," render the phone number. Outside the opening hours, display a message suggesting when demos are available again (e.g., on Friday night, show Monday at 8 am)
-   Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, a newsletter signup)
    -   Describe the feature in a separate markdown file

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **WordPress Theme & Plugin Development** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. Please use the provided boilerplate WordPress install in the `wordpress` folder. You must keep the folder structure intact.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
